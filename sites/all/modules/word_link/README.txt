Example:
"Nam aliquam egestas congue. Sed at odio odio, quis viverra dolor.
Vestibulum sed mauris id elit vehicula tincidunt. Integer quis magna
tortor, non ultrices elit. Nunc quis amet."

Would become:
"Nam aliquam egestas congue. Sed at odio odio,
<a href="www.drupal.org" target="_blank">quis</a> viverra dolor.
Vestibulum sed mauris id elit vehicula tincidunt. Integer
<a href="www.drupal.org" target="_blank">quis</a> magna tortor,
non ultrices elit.
Nunc <a href="www.drupal.org" target="_blank">quis</a> amet."
